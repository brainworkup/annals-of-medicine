  **Objectives.** This evidence report synthesizes the results of evaluations of available tools for diagnosing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults to inform patients, clinicians, and policy makers.
  
  **Review methods.** Following a detailed published protocol and informed by a technical expert panel, we reviewed the evidence for diagnostic tools. In October 2024, we searched nine research databases from inception, research and guideline registries, reference-mined existing reviews and practice guidelines, and consulted with experts to identify evaluations that compared tools used for the diagnosis of ADHD in people of 18 years or older to a clinical diagnosis. The review will be updated during peer review. Registration CRD42025638106.
  
  **Results.** We identified 117 studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of self-report questionnaires, peer review questionnaires, neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, electroencephalogram (EEG), diverse biomarkers, clinician tools, combinations of modalities, and tools to identify feigning ADHD. We found few direct performance comparisons between tests; the strength of evidence (SoE) was often insufficient for evidence statements. There was low SoE for lower clinical misdiagnosis rates (false positive rate in clinical samples) for self-report versus both clinician tools and neuropsychological tests, and for combinations of input versus neuropsychological tests alone. For sensitivity, results favored self-report and combinations of input over neuropsychological tests alone and studies found no difference between self-reports and clinician tools. For specificity, results favored combinations of input over neuropsychological tests alone, and self-reports over clinician tools.
  
  **Conclusions.** A substantial volume of research for diagnostic performance of tests for ADHD in adults exists, in particular for self-report questionnaires and neuropsychological tests. Multiple different diagnostic modalities have been explored and combinations of input appear particularly promising. Despite the volume, evidence was insufficient for several key outcomes. Performance is associated with the comparator and whether diagnostic tools aim to distinguish between adults with ADHD and neurotypical adults, or adults with other clinical conditions.

# Introduction

## Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by
persistent symptoms in the domains of inattention, hyperactivity, and
impulsivity that often begin in childhood.^1^ Clinically significant
symptoms, especially inattention, persist into adulthood in most
individuals.^1-5^ The lifetime prevalence of ADHD is approximately
5.3%,^6^ although epidemiological studies that have not required a
childhood onset have suggested that its prevalence in adults may be as
high as seven percent.^7-10^ Many adults with ADHD adopt lifestyles that
help compensate for their symptoms, they often need to exert excess
energy to overcome impairments. Impaired productivity because of poor
time management, procrastination, and distractibility can limit work
productivity and lower overall quality of life.^11^ Affected adults are
often distressed by their inability to realize their full potential and
by persistent symptoms of restlessness, erratic moods, and poor
self-esteem.^11,\ 12^

ADHD is most often first diagnosed in elementary or middle school age
years or, less commonly, in high school or college when increasing
academic demands surpass the attentional capacities of the affected
person. ADHD can also be first diagnosed in adulthood, when impairments
in attention, organization, and impulsivity produce recurrent problems
with occupational, social, or family functioning. Adult diagnosis is
often difficult because the outward manifestations most readily evident
to others, especially hyperactivity and impulsivity, often improve
during adolescence and no longer meet diagnostic criteria.^13^ The
symptoms of inattention (e.g., easy distractibility, poor organization,
being "spacey," avoiding and trouble completing tasks that require
sustained attention, losing things, forgetfulness) are more subtle and
may not reach the level of obvious functional impairment until
adulthood, within an occupational setting or a marriage.

The diagnosis of ADHD in adults, as in childhood, is complicated by the
overlap of symptoms with other disorders.^14,\ 15^ Attention and
concentration, for example, can be impaired in persons who have
depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychosis, post-traumatic stress
disorder, or substance abuse, or in adults who need to perform well in
an overdemanding environment or who are highly stressed^16^ or
sleep-deprived. Hyperactivity can be confused with anxiety-related
behaviors and the excessive movements of tic and obsessive-compulsive
disorders. Impulsivity is often prominent in bipolar and substance use
disorders. The accurate diagnosis of adult ADHD is further complicated
by individuals who seek stimulant medications to aid cognitive
performance, especially college students and highly driven working
professionals.^17^ Stimulants have long been known to improve sustained
attention and reduce distractibility in healthy individuals who do not
have ADHD,^18-22^ which may prompt success-oriented individuals to feign
symptoms in diagnostic interviews, self-reports, or neuropsychological
test assessments to obtain stimulant medications, and some students
feign illness to receive academic accommodations, such as extended time
on tests, tutoring services, and alternative courses that can improve
their grades.

Claims of exceptional diagnostic performance of these tools, the
differing measures of performance, and the differing performance
characteristics of different versions of a given tool,^23^ are
controversial and often confusing to clinicians, patients, and other
stakeholders. In addition, whether the performance of diagnostic tools
varies with the characteristics of the participants with ADHD or
comparator sample is unknown.^24^ These diagnostic challenges can
complicate the accurate and reliable diagnosis of adult ADHD even for
experienced mental health clinicians.

Thus, despite established criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), diagnosing ADHD in
adults remains challenging due to the frequent absence of hyperactivity
and impulsivity symptoms, the subtlety of inattention symptoms, the
inaccuracy of recall in adults for their retrospective assessments of
ADHD symptoms in childhood (required to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria),
the common symptom overlap with other mental health conditions,^13-15^
and the large number of individuals,^17-22^ including healthy college
students,^25,\ 26^ who feign symptoms to obtain stimulant medications.
Moreover, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, developed primarily for
children, may not be equally suitable for adult diagnosis, and its
requirement that symptoms begin before age 12 has been debated.^27-31^
The absence of a true and undisputed "gold-standard" to verify an ADHD
diagnosis, the variability in performance of diagnostic tools among
clinicians and settings, and the lack of clear practice guidelines
further add to diagnostic complexity.^32-35^

Furthermore, the diagnosis of ADHD in adults is often made not by mental
health specialists, but by primary care physicians and nurse
practitioners,^36^ who may benefit particularly from accurate diagnostic
aids. Further, the dispensing of ADHD medications to adults has
increased steadily over time.^30^ The accuracy of diagnosis directly
affects the management and treatment of ADHD and may help prevent
medication misuse, highlighting the need for effective diagnostic tools
and guidelines. The existing standards and guidelines for diagnosing
ADHD in adults are limited, however, and the use of diagnostic tools and
assessments varies widely in practice.^37-39^ No clinical practice
guidelines for the diagnosis of adults with ADHD have thus far been
developed in the United States, though one is in development.^40^
Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of tools and assessments used in adult
ADHD diagnosis is unclear, and their performance may vary depending on
the characteristics of the ADHD participants and comparator
samples.^23,\ 24^

## Purpose and Scope

This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and unbiased
assessment of diagnostic tools used to diagnose ADHD in adults to inform
patients, clinicians, and policy makers. Commissioned by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), this Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) report documents the evidence for the diagnostic
performance of existing tools for ADHD. We explore the effects of
setting and participant characteristics that may influence the
diagnostic performance of available tools. A contextual question is
which tools are frequently being used in current clinical practice.

# Methods

The systematic review followed a protocol that outlines the methods in
detail.^41^ The methodology followed the EPC Methods Guide.^42^ The
review is registered as CRD42025638106. The project was supported by a
technical expert panel (TEP) to provide different perspectives of a
broad group of interest holders to ensure the evidence report is
relevant to a large audience. The panel included multi-disciplinary
experts in adult ADHD and well as advocates considering the needs of
affected patients as well as family members.

## Key Questions

The systematic review was guided by the following key questions:

- Key Question 1. What is the comparative diagnostic accuracy,
  unintended consequences, and impact of tools that can be used in the
  primary care practice setting or by specialists to diagnose ADHD among
  adults?

  - Key Question 1a: How does the comparative diagnostic accuracy of
    these tools vary by clinical setting, including primary care or
    specialty clinic, or patient characteristics, including age, sex,
    cultural background, and risk factors associated with ADHD?

In addition, a contextual question provided additional information:

- Contextual Question. How frequently are the various tools to diagnose
  ADHD in adults currently being used?

We addressed the key question in a systematic review documented in
detail in the result chapter. Information pertaining to the context
question was incorporated into the discussion.

## Logic Model

Figure 1 illustrates the scope of the review.

Notes: ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, KQ key question

The model shows the population of interest (adults with suspected ADHD)
and depicts the key question (diagnostic test performance) and
sub-question (effect modifiers). The model also shows outcomes, ranging
from side effects of the testing modality (e.g., relevant for invasive
tests), to intermediate outcomes such as the diagnostic accuracy
established in the study, to final outcomes such as the impact of a
diagnosing or misdiagnosing ADHD.

## Search Strategy

The literature search used a combination of known tests to diagnose ADHD
and general search terms for diagnostic accuracy studies to identify
novel tools. In October 2024 we searched PubMed (biomedical literature),
EMBASE (pharmacology emphasis), and PsycINFO (psychological research)
without search date restriction and restricted to English language. The
search strategy was peer reviewed within the EPC program. We used
existing reviews for reference-mining; these were identified through the
same databases plus searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews, Campbell Collaboration, and PROSPERO. We also searched the ECRI
repository, G-I-N, and ClinicalKey for published guidelines and used
these for reference-mining cited literature. All searches will be
updated during the public comment period.

In addition, we leveraged technical experts to ensure that relevant
research studies had been identified. We provided a list of included
studies, together with all associated publications, and a list of
excluded studies to facilitate this process. A Supplemental Evidence And
Data for Systematic Reviews (SEADs) portal was available from January 10
to February 4 2025 for this review. Additional data and publications
suggested to us from any source, including peer and public review, will
be screened applying the outlined eligibility criteria. The search will
be updated during peer review.

Included ADHD tests were not limited to a set of pre-specified tools;
instead, the review documents all tools that have been evaluated in the
scientific literature and for which diagnostic accuracy evidence exists.
Studies had to compare to a clinical diagnosis made by a clinician in a
formal diagnostic interview, typically enhanced by information from
patient questionnaires. We searched databases from inception and we did
not apply any publication date restrictions. Studies with data
exclusively published in non-English language publications were excluded
to ensure transparency. We obtained all published reports providing data
on a study (a study is defined by the included participants), including
trial records and multiple publications, and consolidated the
information into one study record.

### Screening Process

We used an online database designed for systematic reviews to screen the
literature search output. The team designed detailed citation and full
text screening forms to ensure a transparent, consistent, and
unambiguous approach. All citations were screened by two independent
literature reviewers. Citations found to be potentially relevant by at
least one reviewer were obtained as full text. All citations were also
screened by a DistillerSR software machine learning algorithm trained by
the human reviewers to ensure that no relevant citation was missed. Any
citations identified as potentially relevant by the algorithm that were
not selected for full text publication review were rescreened for
relevance by an independent literature reviewer.

Full text screening applied the detailed eligibility criteria. Training
ensured a shared understanding of all inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Full text publications were screened by two independent reviewers to
reduce errors and bias, and any discrepancy was resolved through
discussion in the review team. The screening decisions and reasons for
exclusion of publications were tracked in the online database and
citation management software. These citations were shared with the
technical expert panel and were documented with the review to ensure
that the literature flow was transparent and objective.

## Data Extraction and Abstraction

We captured detailed information about eligible studies. One literature
reviewer extracted data and categorized information where relevant, and
an experienced methodologist checked the data for accuracy and
completeness. We designed and pilot tested a detailed form in the
software DistillerSR to ensure accuracy and minimize ambiguity.

The data abstraction documented the targeted population and
characteristics of all included participants (participants with ADHD and
those without). We documented the clinical setting, method of
establishing the reference standard (a clinical ADHD diagnosis), and
diagnostic tool characteristics (format, name of the tool, employed cut
offs, use of a training and validation set). We collected data for a
diagnostic meta-analysis where possible (i.e., number of false
positives, number of false negatives) along with the summary diagnosis
accuracy measures reported by the authors such as sensitivity,
specificity, area under the curve, positive predictive value. We
differentiated between the diagnostic accuracy to diagnose ADHD and the
diagnostic accuracy to detect faking ADHD. For all studies reporting
multiple results, we selected the best accuracy performance model
(either based on the authors' opinion, accuracy data, or trying to
maximize sensitivity and specificity simultaneously).

## []{#_Toc193750145 .anchor}2.6 Risk of Bias Assessment

The critical appraisal for individual studies applied criteria
consistent with QUADAS 2.^43^ QUADAS-2 evaluates four domains: *patient
selection*, *index test* characteristics, *reference standard* quality,
as well as *flow and timing:*

- Patient selection: The domain addresses whether the selection of
  patients could have introduced bias, taking into account whether the
  study enrolled a consecutive or random sample, whether the data are
  not based on a retrospective case-control design, and whether the
  study avoided inappropriate or problematic exclusions from the patient
  pool.

- Index test: The domain evaluates whether the conduct or interpretation
  of the test could have introduced bias, taking into account whether
  the results of the test were interpreted without knowledge of the
  results of the reference standard and whether any thresholds or
  cut-offs were pre-specified (e.g., instead of determined during the
  study to maximize diagnostic performance).

- Reference standard: The domain evaluates whether the reference
  standard, its conduct, or its interpretation may have introduced bias,
  taking into account the quality of the reference standard in correctly
  classifying the condition and whether the reference standard test
  results were interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index
  test.

- Flow and timing: The last domain evaluates whether the conduct of the
  study may have introduced bias. The assessment takes into account
  whether the interval between the test and the reference standard was
  appropriate, whether all patients received the reference standard and
  whether they received the same reference standard, and whether all
  patients were included in the analysis.

For each domain, we assessed the potential risk of bias in the study to
identify high risk of bias and low risk of bias studies. One literature
reviewer assessed risk of bias, and a methodologist reviewed individual
studies and rating across studies to ensure accuracy and consistency of
ratings. As outlined in the applicability section, we also evaluated for
each study and appraisal domain whether there were concerns regarding
the applicability of the study results to the review question. This
encompassed whether the patients included in the studies matched the
review question; whether the test, its conduct, or interpretation
differed from the review question; or whether the target condition as
defined by the reference standard fully matched the review question. The
information was incorporated into the strength of evidence assessment.

## Assessing Applicability

Results are based on the international literature and applicability
ratings provided assessments regarding the generalizability of samples,
settings, and tool results for U.S. clinical practice. For each study,
we assessed the population included in the study to identify studies
with narrow eligibility criteria (e.g., looking for a specific subgroup
of ADHD participants only), studies that excluded participants with
comorbidities, or studies that had more complex participants than
typically seen in the community (e.g., dually diagnosed participants).
We assessed whether studies described tools not used as recommended or
commonly used in practice, the presence of highly trained test team or
set up (e.g., analysis via complex machine learning models), or
assessors that were not qualified for the assessment. We assessed
whether the reference standard was ambiguous, different from standard
clinical practice, or insufficiently described.

## Data Synthesis and Analysis

We answered the key question with the available evidence. We broadly
differentiated diagnostic tools as

- Self-report questionnaires

- Peer report questionnaires

- Neuropsychological tests

- Neuroimaging

- EEG

- Biomarker

- Observational data

- Clinician tools

- Combination predictions using more than one modality

- Tests to detect feigning of ADHD

We documented comparative effect results where studies compared the
performance of more than one tool. In addition, we documented the range
of results reported in studies within each tool category (e.g.,
self-reports). We documented the diagnostic accuracy results for all
outcomes as reported by the authors in the individual studies.
Sensitivity estimates were documented together with specificity
estimates given that the estimates are not independent. A detailed
evidence table displays key characteristics, the reference standard,
psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy outcomes for all
included studies. In addition, we identified the number of true
positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives where
clearly reported for use in a diagnostic meta-analysis. All studies were
considered for the narrative synthesis accompanying the summary of
findings table.

We documented the results for available diagnostic tools across studies
in a comprehensive summary of findings table documenting all assessed
outcomes related to the diagnostic accuracy, reliability, and impact of
the tool. Key outcomes for the summary of findings table were determined
with the help of the TEP:

- Clinical misdiagnosis (risk of missed condition that can appear as
  ADHD)

- Sensitivity

- Specificity

- Administration and scoring time

- Inter-rater reliability

- Costs

- Diagnostic concordance of primary care provider with specialist

The synthesis took study limitations and the risk of bias of individual
studies contributing to estimates into account. We determined whether
summary estimates corresponded to data reported in low risk of bias
studies or were primarily based on high risk of studies.

To address the sub-question, we reported on subgroup results for
different clinical settings (differentiating general and specialty care
settings), patient characteristics (differentiating sex, age, cultural
background, and comorbidity groups), and ADHD presentation
(differentiating predominantly inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive,
combined). We assessed whether these variables can explain heterogeneity
identified in results across studies.

To address the contextual question, we documented the frequency of
identified research for each individual tool. In addition, we summarized
data sources that reported on the frequency of tool use in clinical
practice with emphasis on the U.S. healthcare setting in the discussion.

## Grading the Strength of the Body of Evidence

We applied the EPC strength of evidence criteria to evaluate the body of
evidence. In determining the quality of the body of evidence, the
following domains were evaluated:

- Study limitations: The extent to which studies reporting on a
  particular outcome for a specific test were likely to be protected
  from bias. The aggregate risk of bias across individual studies
  reporting an outcome was considered; graded as low, medium, or high
  level of study limitations.

- Inconsistency: The extent to which studies reported the same direction
  and/or magnitude of effects for a particular outcome; graded as
  consistent, inconsistent, or unknown (in the case of a single study or
  the absence of studies).

- Indirectness: Determines whether the test and the comparator were
  directly (i.e., within studies) or indirectly (e.g., across studies)
  compared. The domain was graded as direct or indirect.

- Imprecision: Describes the level of certainty of the estimate of
  effect for a particular outcome, where a precise estimate is one that
  allows a clinically useful conclusion. The domain was graded as
  precise or imprecise.

- Reporting bias: Publication bias, selective outcome reporting, and
  selective analysis reporting are types of reporting bias. Reporting
  bias is difficult to assess as systematic identification of
  unpublished evidence is challenging.

A final strength of evidence grade for each evidence statement was
assigned by evaluating and weighing the combined results of the above
domains. We formulated comparative evidence statements based on direct
comparisons of tests within studies. For all other tests, we evaluated
the magnitude of the effects for the outcomes of interest. Given that
most outcomes showed some variation and a precise pooled estimate was
not available, we broadly characterized the magnitude as follows based
on the observed performance and published suggestions:

- Clinical misdiagnosis: low (\<5%), fair (\<20-5%), substantial
  (20-60%) rate

<!-- -->

- Sensitivity and specificity: limited (\<80%); poor (\<69%), fair
  (70-79%), acceptable (80-89%), good (90-95%), excellent (96-100%)

- Administration and scoring time: short (\<30 minutes)

- Rater agreement: limited (kappa \<0.8, correlations \<0.40)

- Costs and concordance: N/A

We differentiated an overall grade of high, moderate, low, or
insufficient according to a four-level scale:

- High: We are very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to
  the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has few or no
  deficiencies. We believe that the findings are stable (i.e., another
  study would not change the conclusions).

- Moderate: We are moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies
  close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has
  some deficiencies. We believe that the findings are likely to be
  stable, but some doubt remains.

- Low: We have limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close
  to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has major or
  numerous deficiencies (or both). We believe that additional evidence
  is needed before concluding either that the findings are stable or
  that the estimate of effect is close to the true effect.

- Insufficient: We have no evidence, we are unable to estimate an
  effect, or we have no confidence in the estimate of effect for this
  outcome. No evidence is available, or the body of evidence has
  unacceptable deficiencies, precluding reaching a conclusion.

The summary of findings table included the reasons for downgrading or
upgrading the strength of evidence. The strength of evidence assessment
documented uncertainty and communicated our confidence in the evidence
statements that can be drawn from the literature.

We identified 117 studies meeting inclusion criteria reported in 121
publications.^44-164^ The earliest identified study was published in
1997.^135^ Studies evaluated tools in Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark,
Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, USA, or combined evaluations in
multiple countries. Sample sizes varied widely, from a dozen
participants to large samples with over a thousand
participants.^48,\ 121,\ 153^ Studies included participants diagnosed
with ADHD and compared to different non-ADHD samples. These included
neurotypical adults not diagnosed with ADHD, adults from a clinical
sample evaluated or diagnosed for another clinical condition, and/or
adults feigning ADHD. Half of the included studies (51%) incorporated a
neurotypical group of adults that did not meet criteria for ADHD, and in
some cases, were also selected specifically because they also never had
a childhood diagnosis of ADHD. Many studies (40%) compared participants
with a diagnosis of ADHD to a clinical sample of participants who were
being evaluated for another clinical condition. In addition, two studies
each (1%) compared to participants with autism,^78,\ 122^ conduct
disorder or anger dysregulation,^88,\ 98^ or depression,^119,\ 130^
respectively. A quarter (23%) of the identified studies included
participants identified or specifically trained to pretend to have ADHD.
Studies varied in whether they included an additional group (e.g., a
neurotypical or clinical sample), but some studies included only
participants feigning ADHD, which were compared to participants with a
diagnosis of ADHD.^44,\ 127,\ 133,\ 134^

The risk of bias across studies is shown in figure 3.

<!-- ![](media/image2.png){width="6.895522747156606in" height="2.3040748031496063in"} -->

Nearly half of the identified studies demonstrated high risk of bias in
patient selection, indicating prevalent issues with how participants
were recruited and selected across the evidence base. Almost two thirds
of studies exhibited high risk of bias in the index test domain,
indicating widespread concerns about how diagnostic tools were applied
and interpreted. The reference standard domain showed the most favorable
profile, with about 60 percent of studies at low risk of bias and about
20 percent at high risk, suggesting relatively good quality in how the
diagnostic "gold standard" was implemented. The flow and timing domain
shows that nearly 60 percent of studies showed high risk of bias in flow
and timing, indicating significant concerns about the sequence and
intervals of test administration and analysis.

The applicability assessment assessing the generalizability of study
results identified in this review is summarized in figure 4.

Reported Results

Few studies had no applicability concerns regarding population, with
most studies having narrow eligibility criteria or including more
complex patients than typical of community settings. Half the studies
had no applicability concerns regarding the test, though many others
used tests not common in current practice, or they employed highly
selected teams not representative of typical clinical settings. About
half of the studies had no applicability concerns for the reference
standard, with the remaining studies showing unclear DSM-5 diagnostic
criteria or other reference standard issues limiting generalizability.
Half the studies indicated no applicability concerns regarding outcomes,
with many others using surrogate outcomes that may not directly
translate to clinical practice. Most studies had applicability concerns
regarding setting, with the vast majority conducted in care levels
different from community settings, limiting their generalizability to
routine practice.

Identified studies reported on self-report questionnaires, peer review
tools, neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, electroencephalogram
(EEG), diverse biomarkers, clinician tools, combinations of modalities,
and tools to identify feigning ADHD. Studies reported on the success of
identifying ADHD, success in identifying feigning and exaggerating of
ADHD symptoms, or both.

[]{#_Toc193750151 .anchor}3.2 Results of Key Question 1: What is the
comparative diagnostic accuracy, unintended consequences, and impact of
tools that can be used in the primary care practice setting or by
specialists to diagnose ADHD among adults?

We identified numerous studies that included multiple tools used alone
or in combination. However, not all studies reported diagnostic
performance for all tools and combinations, and only selected studies
allowed direct comparisons.

The 11 studies with head-to-head comparisons between modalities compared
primarily self-report questionnaires with other modalities, including
parent ratings,^122^ peer reports,^65,\ 98^ a combination of self and
other ratings,^65,\ 98,\ 154^ neuropsychological tests,^98,\ 145^ a
combination of self-report and EEG;^132^ and clinician tools.^98,\ 100^
Three studies compared neuropsychological test results to combinations
of input;^78,\ 119,\ 123^ one compared a neuropsychological test and one
compared EEG data under Go/NoGo task conditions with task performance
indicators.^54^ Table 2 documents the results for key outcomes for the
comparative studies.

Notes: N/A not available, not applicable; N number of participants

Several identified studies compared multiple tests, but not all reported
results for all outcomes of interest for every test. Two studies
compared self-reports versus a clinician interview tool, both reported a
lower rate of clinical misdiagnoses for in the direct
comparison.^100,\ 123^ Two studies found no difference in sensitivity
between self-report and a clinician tool.^98,\ 100^ Two studies reported
higher sensitivity for self-reports versus neuropsychological
tests.^98,\ 145^ Two studies reported higher specificity for
self-reports over a clinician tool.^98,\ 100^

Three studies reported on sensitivity for combinations of input versus
neuropsychological tests alone, all found higher values for the
combination^78,\ 98,\ 123^ One study compared a combination to EEG
marker alone and also reported results in favor of the combination.^132^
Four studies found higher specificity for combinations of input versus
neuropsychological tests alone^78,\ 98,\ 123^ or EEG marker alone.^132^

Evidence for all other comparisons was insufficient and we were not able
to make comparative evidence statement for the outcomes administration
time, inter-rater reliability, costs, or concordance between primary and
specialty care diagnoses. All available comparative results across test
modalities (e.g., combinations of variables vs neuropsychological test
results alone) are documented in the summary of findings table (Table
3).

### Combination

Eight studies reported on a combination of input from different
modalities.^57,\ 65,\ 78,\ 98,\ 119,\ 123,\ 132,\ 154^ Several included
self and informant symptom ratings, and some also used demographic
variables, neuropsychological assessment results, or EEG data. Studies
varied in their complexity of the combination; one study, supported by
machine learning, used 93 variables.^57^ The Appendix Table C.1
documents results for all studies that evaluated a combination.

Reported clinical false positive rate ranged from 16 percent in a study
combining self-ratings and QBTest data to distinguish ADHD from
Asperger's syndrome^78^ to 18 percent in a study combining multiple
self-reports and an observer report to distinguish from aggression.^98^
As illustrated in Figure 8, sensitivity was variable but mostly good,
but not excellent. Reported sensitivity ranged from 94 percent
(corresponding specificity 84%)^78^ to 43 percent (corresponding
specificity 83%)^154^ in the identified studies. Specificity ranged from
84 percent (corresponding sensitivity 94%)^78^ to 82 percent
(corresponding sensitivity 91%).^98^ We found no data for the outcomes
administration time, inter-rater reliability, costs, or concordance
between primary and specialty care diagnoses. The table shows the
specific combinations used to diagnose ADHD. Results for key outcomes
are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193750153 .anchor}3.2.2 Self-Report Questionnaires

Forty-three studies reported at least one self-report measure evaluated
for its performance in diagnosing ADHD. The studies reported on numerous
self-report measures: ADHD Rating Scale, ADSA (Attention-Deficit Scales
for Adults), AHA (Assessment of Hyperactivity and Attention), ALS-SF
(Affective Lability Scale-Short Form), APQ (Adult Problem
Questionnaire), ASRS (Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale), ASSET-BS (ADHD
Symptom and Side Effect Tracking Baseline Scale), BAARS-IV Barkley Adult
ADHD Rating Scale), BADDS (Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale),
CAARS (Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale), CBS (Current Behavior Scale),
EarlyDetect Questionnaire, IPDE-SQ (International Personality Disorder
Examination screening questionnaire), PAI (Personality Assessment
Inventory), PDI-4 (Provisional Diagnostic Instrument), SR-WRAADDS
(Self-Report Wender-Reimherr Adult ADHD Scale), and WURS (Wender Utah
Rating Scale). Nine studies reported on more than one
questionnaire.^62,\ 63,\ 92,\ 108,\ 111,\ 120,\ 130,\ 135,\ 142^ The
Appendix Table C.2 documents results for all studies that evaluated a
written self-report for the diagnosis of ADHD.

Performance for clinical misdiagnosis varied across studies but was
generally substantial: reported false positive rates in clinical samples
ranged from 12 percent differentiating from depression or generalized
anxiety using the WURS^130^ to 90 percent in students with academic or
psychological difficulties using the CAARS-S.^101^ The ability to detect
ADHD varied but was good for many questionnaires as illustrated in
Figure 5.

Neurotypical only = true indicates that the study differentiated ADHD
from neurotypical adults, neurotypical only = false indicates that the
study differentiated ADHD from other clinical conditions or a
combination of neurotypical adults and adults with other clinical
conditions

Figure 5 represents each study that reported on a self-report with one
questionnaire, selecting the scale with the highest sensitivity and
specificity where more than one tool was evaluated. In the individual
studies sensitivity ranged from 100 percent at the expense of low
specificity (CAARS-S corresponding specificity 10%^101^ or ASRS-v1.1
with specificity not reported)^58^ to only 14 percent (CAARS-S,
corresponding specificity 92%).^86^ The ability of self reports to
correctly rule out ADHD was good in many cases but also rarely
excellent: Specificity ranged from 99 percent (CBS corresponding
sensitivity 90%)^71^ to as low as 10 percent (CAARS-S, corresponding
sensitivity 100%).^101^ Only one study explicitly reported on the
administration time for the questionnaire, indicating short
administration.^105^ Rater agreement was reported in multiple studies,
with most studies indicating limited agreement between different
raters.^50,\ 65,\ 98,\ 100,\ 108,\ 109,\ 154,\ 163^ We did not identify
data on cost or correspondence between primary and specialty care.
Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings
table (Table 3).

### []{#_Toc193750154 .anchor}3.2.3 Peer Report Questionnaires

Three studies evaluated peer reports.^65,\ 122,\ 124^ One of the studies
asked parents to rate their young adults with autism using the CAARS-P
and the ABC (Aberrant Behavior Checklist).^122^ Another study included
parent ratings of undergraduates using the BAARS-IV (Barkley Adult ADHD
Rating Scale-IV).^65^ In both studies, the peer report was a parent
rating of young adults. One study in a forensic outpatient clinic
reported on CAARS-Observer ratings but did not state who served as the
rater.^98^ The Appendix Table C.3 documents all results for the small
number of studies that evaluated a written peer report for the diagnosis
of ADHD.

Evidence for clinical misdiagnosis was determined to be insufficient due
to lack of information on the observers in the single clinical sample.
Sensitivity was determined to be insufficient due to the wide reported
range (from poor to good). Specificity was limited and ranged from fair
to poor (77% for BAARS-IV, corresponding sensitivity 60%,^65^ 57% for
CAARS-P, corresponding sensitivity 60%);^122^ both illustrated in Figure
8. For rater agreement, only one study reported results and none of the
studies reported on costs, administration time, or concordance between
primary and specialty care. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in
the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193981779 .anchor}3.2.4 Neuropsychological Assessment

Twenty-seven studies reported on the performance of neuropsychological
assessment to diagnose ADHD. Studies evaluated test batteries such as
AQT, BQSS, C-CPT, DII, IVA, MOXO-dCPT, QbTest, SCWT, SNST, or the
performance of individual tasks such as the Go-NoGo task or WAIS-IV
Processing Speed Index. Five studies reported diagnostic accuracy data
for multiple tests and tasks.^59,\ 107,\ 140,\ 151,\ 160^ The Appendix
Table C.4 documents results for all neuropsychological tests evaluated
to diagnose ADHD. The index test description shows the evaluated test
selection that showed the best performance, together with all
administered tests.

Performance for clinical misdiagnoses showed a substantial false
positive rate in most studies. Reported results ranged from 11 percent
in a study using Stroop test variables for participants referred for
neuropsychological evaluation^95^ to 60 percent in a model based on
QbTest with motion tracking variables,^144^ Sensitivity was acceptable
in most studies as illustrated in Figure 6, but reported sensitivity
showed a wide range from 93 percent (corresponding specificity 100%)
integrating AQT variables^118^ to 17 percent for an individual subtest
of the C-CPT (corresponding specificity 90%).^146^

Figure 6 shows the different specific evaluated tests as well as the
substantial number of studies that did not evaluate a specific tool but
used variables in a test battery to develop a models that maximizes the
ability to discriminate between ADHD and comparator characteristics. The
figure also shows the wide variation in specificity, with some studies
reporting excellent specificity, but most studies were characterized by
acceptable or even poor specificity. Reported specificity ranged from
100 percent (corresponding sensitivity 93%) integrating AQT
variables^118^ to 40 percent for a model integrating QbTest Plus
variables (corresponding sensitivity 88%).^144^

There was some variation, but 7 studies estimated the duration of the
neuropsychological test administration to be about 20
minutes.^45,\ 55,\ 66,\ 69,\ 78,\ 123,\ 144^ None of the studies
reported on rater agreement, costs, or concordance between diagnostic
settings. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of
Findings table (Table 3).

### Neuroimaging

Five studies evaluated neuroimaging.^48,\ 56,\ 136,\ 157,\ 161^ Studies
used brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT),^48^ 3-D SPECT,^136^ structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and diffusion tensor imaging,^56^ and resting state functional
MRI.^157,\ 161^ The Appendix Table C.5 documents results of studies that
evaluated neuroimaging for the diagnosis of ADHD. The table provides
details on the final selection model where reported.

Reported clinical misdiagnoses rates varied from a low three percent in
a brain perfusion SPECT study analyzing a large psychiatric database^48^
to a substantial 24 percent false positive rate in a sample with various
psychiatric and neuropsychiatric disorders using 3D thresholded
SPECT.^136^ Studies reported sensitivity ranges from excellent to poor,
but it was acceptable in most studies. Performance ranged from 100
percent in a large retrospective cohort study using brain perfusion
SPECT (corresponding specificity 97%)^48^ to 54 percent in a clinical
sample (SPECT, corresponding specificity 76%). Similarly, reported
specificity ranged from 97 percent (SPECT, corresponding sensitivity
100%)^48^ to 65 percent (functional MRI, corresponding sensitivity
91%),^161^ but most studies reported acceptable specificity as
illustrated in Figure 8. Studies varied in how much detail the often
machine-learning generated discriminant function that achieved the best
diagnostic performance was documented. Only one study reported on
administration time; the study reported a procedure duration of 15 to 20
minutes.^136^ One study evaluated rater agreement, the study reported a
kappa coefficient of 0.79 for agreement in visual interpretation of
neuroimaging scans.^48^ None of the studies reported on costs or
concordance of diagnostic results between different clinical settings.
Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings
table (Table 3).

### EEG

Twelve studies evaluated EEG (electroencephalogram) data used to
distinguish ADHD from other clinical conditions or neurotypical
developing
adults.^54,\ 80,\ 89,\ 91,\ 96,\ 97,\ 115,\ 116,\ 125,\ 126,\ 132,\ 139^
Studies tested the diagnostic performance for very different conditions,
ranging from analyzing resting state EEG,^96,\ 125^ and event-related
potentials during neuropsychological tasks,^54,\ 115^ to EEG recording
during transcranial magnetic stimulation.^80^ The Appendix Table C.6
documents results for the studies that evaluated the use of EEG data for
the diagnosis of ADHD.

Only one study reported on misdiagnosis in a clinical sample; the study
reported a low false positive rate of 3.8 percent using auditory
brainstem response profiling test.^89^ Most studies were conducted in
academic samples and did not involve clinical samples. Reported
sensitivity results ranged from 100 percent achieved in a
machine-learning assisted diagnostic study that utilized phase space
reconstruction of brain signals during a continuous performance test
(corresponding specificity 87%)^91^ to only 67 percent (resting state
EEG, corresponding specificity 83%)^125^ with overall acceptable
results. Specificity showed an even wider range from excellent to poor
performance: Reported specificity ranged from 95 percent (event-related
potential, corresponding sensitivity 86%)^54^ to 37 percent (resting
state EEG, corresponding sensitivity 73%)^96^ but was generally good in
identified studies. Reported session duration ranged from six
minutes^96^ to 26 minutes^116^ with no information about the scoring or
interpretation time. Studies did not report on rater agreement, costs,
or concordance with diagnoses from other settings. Results for key
outcomes are synthesized in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

### Biomarkers

Five studies evaluated biomarkers other than EEG or neuroimaging-based
indicators.^49,\ 79,\ 88,\ 138,\ 150^ Studies evaluated very different
markers, including genetic marker,^79^ eye tracking results,^88^ blood
oxidative status,^138^ physiological data from a wearable device,^49^ or
used MFNU (Motor Function Neurological Assessment)^150^ to diagnose
ADHD. None of the same modality or type of biomarker was evaluated in
more than one study. The Appendix Table C.7 documents all results for
the small number of studies that evaluated the use of biomarkers other
than neuroimaging or EEG to aid in the diagnosis of ADHD.

The clinical misdiagnosis rate varied widely: one study reported a false
positive rate of 17 percent in an eye tracker study in sample of
participants with conduct disorder,^88^ another study reported a false
positive rate of 75 percent in a MFNU assessment in a psychiatric
outpatient clinic where some patients were considered to have
subthreshold ADHD.^150^ Sensitivity was acceptable in most studies and
showed a range of 98 percent for MFNU (corresponding specificity
25%)^150^ to 80 percent in an eye tracker study (corresponding
specificity 83%).^88^ Specificity varied widely, from 83 percent in the
eye tracker study (corresponding sensitivity 80%)^88^ to only 25 percent
in the MFNU assessment (corresponding sensitivity 98%). Only one study
reported on the administration time, the study reported that the eye
tracking task took about 15 minutes;^88^ none of the studies reported on
test result processing, evaluation, or interpretation time. Studies did
not report on rater agreement in interpreting the variables, costs, or
concordance between settings. Results for key outcomes are synthesized
in the Summary of Findings table (Table 3).

### Clinician Tool

Three studies reported on a clinician interview or questionnaire that
was assessed for congruence with an external reference
standard.^100,\ 121,\ 123^ Studies evaluated the DIVA (Diagnostic
Interview for ADHD in Adults),^123^ MINI (Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric Interview),^100^ the MINI-Plus^121^ which were used by
clinicians in clinical samples. The reference standards used to evaluate
the diagnostic performance of the clinician tools were assessments from
trained clinicians,^121^ the recorded chart diagnosis,^100^ or clinical
case conferences.^123^ The Appendix Table C.8 documents study and
participant details, and presents all reported results for these
studies.

The results reported in the identified studies varied widely for the
clinical misdiagnosis: false positive rates ranged from nine percent for
the MINI-Plus in an addiction treatment center study^121^ to 48 percent
in an inpatient psychiatric hospital unit for the CAARS-O.^100^ The
sensitivity was acceptable, performance ranged from 83 percent
(corresponding specificity 52%) to 73 percent (corresponding specificity
90%).^123^ Specificity showed a wider range, reported results included
good as well as poor sensitivity: performance ranged from 91 percent
(corresponding sensitivity 75%)^121^ to 52 percent (corresponding
sensitivity 83%).^100^ The identified studies did not report on
administration time, rater agreement, costs, or concordance with
specialty care. Results for key outcomes are synthesized in the Summary
of Findings table (Table 3).

[]{#_Toc193981784 .anchor}3.2.9 Key Question 1a: How does the
comparative diagnostic accuracy of these tools vary by clinical setting,
including primary care or specialty clinic, or patient characteristics,
including age, sex, cultural background, and risk factors associated
with ADHD?

Because raw data for diagnostic accuracy were often not reported, we
were not able to detect effect modifiers in meta-regressions by adding
variables to the meta-analytic model. Results are based on subgroups as
reported by the authors and analyses conducted within the original
studies.

**Clinical setting**: Half of the identified studies were conducted in
specialty care (n=55). The next most frequent setting was college
(n=37). Very few studies were conducted in primary care (n=2). In
addition, none of the identified studies analyzed the effect of the
setting on the diagnostic process. Hence the question which tests should
be used in primary care is difficult to answer. However, several studies
addressed the effect of the reference standard and comparator sample,
i.e., study characteristics. In addition, several studies addressed the
effect of comorbidities. Although primarily a patient characteristic,
participants evaluated for other clinical conditions was more typical of
a specialty care clinical setting.

**Reference standard and comparator sample**: Three studies addressed
the effect of the method of establishing a clinical ADHD diagnosis, but
all addressed different aspects. One study comparing self-reported and
neuropsychological tests highlighted that diagnostic accuracy measures
were high when comparing ADHD-diagnosed participants to the general
population but were less effective when distinguishing ADHD from other
psychiatric conditions, with overlapping scores noted for anxiety and
depression.^145^ Similarly, a self report study reported a high
false-positive rate in patients with depression.^64^ Another study
evaluating a self-report measure reported that comorbidities such as
anxiety and depression were associated with elevated scores on scales
which may overlap with ADHD symptoms and potentially contribute to
misclassification and highlighted the importance of considering comorbid
conditions during assessment.^102^ One study evaluating neuromuscular
assessment reported that they found several patients with subthreshold
ADHD in a clinical sample suggesting possible diagnostic overlap and the
need for further evaluation.^150^

Figure 7 differentiates two diagnostic accuracy measures, overall
accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC), for all diagnostic
modalities. The figure stratifies studies by samples that identified
ADHD in a sample of neurotypical adults, in a clinical sample, or in
samples that included neurotypical adults, adults with other clinical
conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, and/or adults feigning
ADHD.

[]{#_Toc201103281 .anchor}Figure 7. Reported Accuracy and Area Under the
Curve (AUC) Across Tools

<!-- ![](media/image6.emf){width="6.5in" height="4.530555555555556in"} -->

Figure 7 visualizes a trend toward higher diagnostic accuracy when tools
distinguish between people with ADHD and neurotypical adults: diagnostic
performance exceeded that of results in clinical samples in five out of
six studies reporting on overall accuracy and in three out of four test
modalities in studies that reported on AUC.

**ADHD presentation**: Four studies addressed diagnosis in different
presentations of ADHD with some conflicting results. One-self-report
study reported that diagnostic accuracy did not significantly vary
across ADHD presentations/subtypes (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive,
and combined) but noted that combined type ADHD was the most frequently
identified subtype, which could influence overall sensitivity and
specificity estimates.^141^ Similarly, another study reported that
sensitivity and specificity were consistent across ADHD presentation
types (inattentive, hyperactive, and combined), but noted that
misdiagnosis rates were slightly higher for the inattentive subtype in
self reports compared to clinician diagnoses, and inter-rater
reliability between self-reported and clinical ratings was fair, with
higher concordance for combined presentation.^70^ Another self report
study highlighted that sensitivity for the inattentive subtype was 100
percent on the Inattentive Symptoms subscale, with specificity at 25
percent.^101^ One self report study pointed out that inattention
symptoms were more predictive of ADHD persistence into adulthood than
hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms; and individuals with the
combined-type ADHD in childhood were more likely to retain a diagnosis
in adulthood, whereas hyperactive-impulsive presentations were more
likely to remit.^94^

**Participant age**: Several studies reported on the effect of the age
of the participants or specifically on the age at diagnosis, but studies
focused on different aspects. A self-report study reported that
executive functioning impairments were more predictive of ADHD
persistence in older adults, while hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms
were more prevalent in younger adults, suggesting age-related shifts in
symptom expression and diagnostic criteria applicability; sensitivity
and specificity of ADHD diagnoses were higher in younger adults (18--30
years) compared to older adults (31--44 years), likely due to better
recall of childhood symptoms and reduced cognitive decline in
memory-based reporting.^94^ A self report and neuropsychological test
study reported that age was inversely correlated with scores on scales
for attention and effort, suggesting that older participants exhibited
fewer ADHD-related symptoms, potentially reflecting developmental
improvements in executive functioning.^145^ One study did not comment on
differential effects on the diagnosis, but suggested that a potential
biomarker, oxidative stress, may increase with the duration of the
disease.^138^ Another study found that age represented as independent
variable in a multiple regression did not significantly influence
parameters measured by the QbTest.^55^ A further study reported that
ADHD diagnosis based on CAARS-S or MINI were not correlated with
age.^100^

**Participant sex**: Several studies reported on the effect of the sex
of the participants on the diagnostic performance, but studies reported
conflicting results. One EEG study reported lower sensitivity in females
compared to males.^89^ A neuroimaging study noted that classification
performance was higher in the male-only subgroup compared to the
mixed-gender subgroup, suggesting that male ADHD patients may have more
significant neuroanatomical deviations from controls.^56^ A self-report
study did not find lower sensitivity but lower specificity in females
versus males.^155^ One study concluded that sex did not influence
parameters of the neuropsychological test.^55^ A self-report study did
not detect differences in sensitivity and specificity between
sexes.^163^ A study reporting on a self-report and a clinician interview
noted that ADHD diagnosis based on the tests were not correlated with
sex.^100^

**Participant ethnicity**: None of the studies stratified diagnostic
performance by race or ethnicity.

**Comorbidities**: Multiple studies reported on the effect of
comorbidities in participants with ADHD on diagnostic performance, but
results and conclusions differed. One college study reported that
comorbidities contributed to challenges in specificity but not
sensitivity and that functional impairment was higher in participants
with comorbid conditions.^101^ Similarly, a study in addiction centers
reported on variability in specificity values across subgroups while
sensitivity remained similar.^153^ Another study reported reduced
specificity in participants with overlapping symptoms of borderline
personality disorder and bipolar disorder in neuropsychiatric
clinics.^66^ One study reported lower sensitivity and higher specificity
in participants with comorbidity in a mental health center.^106^ Two
studies in outpatient centers reported that diagnostic performance was
unaffected by comorbidities.^55,\ 102^ Some studies pointed out the high
prevalence of comorbid conditions such as depression and
anxiety.^77,\ 94,\ 135,\ 141^ One study suggested that participants with
ADHD and depression reported higher levels of anxiety.^64^

### Key Question 1 Summary of Findings

Despite the large number of studies, many did not report on the exact
number of true positives, true negatives etc. The most common metrics
were the author reported sensitivity. Given that sensitivity and
specificity are not independent of each other, we plotted both for all
reported tests in Figure 8. The tool indicates also whether studies
differentiate adults with ADHD from neurotypical adults or adults with
another clinical diagnosis.

[]{#_Toc193981861 .anchor}Figure 8. Sensitivity and Specificity of ADHD
Tests in Adults across Studies

<!-- ![](media/image7.emf){width="6.5in" height="4.530555555555556in"} -->

Figure 8 visualizes the much larger evidence base for self-reports
compared to all other modalities. The figure also illustrates the wide
variability reported in the individual studies for the same modality. In
addition, the visualization shows that tests were sometimes able to
maximize sensitivity or specificity, but not both. Finally, with few
exceptions, the evaluated tests were limited in their success of
detecting a clinical diagnosis of ADHD.

The summary of findings table (Table 3) provides a synthesis of the
results for the key outcomes. Direct comparisons between test modalities
are shown first, followed by the test performance for individual tests,
and the summary of the subquestion. The summary of findings table shows
results for the key outcomes for which at least one study with data was
identified. The clinical misdiagnosis results were limited to studies
reporting on clinical samples and/or studies comparing to another
clinical condition such as anxiety. We downgraded by one or by two,
depending on the impact of the reasons for downgrading on our confidence
in the summary estimate and resulting evidence statements. Results of
individual studies for all abstracted outcomes beyond the key outcomes
are shown in the evidence tables in Appendix C.

The included studies did not report on the impact for participants of
being correctly or incorrectly diagnosed. Studies reported only on the
performance of the tests but not the effect a diagnosis (or a
misdiagnosis) had on participants or similar.

None of the included studies reported on unintended consequences,
adverse events, adverse effects, or side effects of the diagnostic
tools, including blood-based biomarker, EEG, neuroimaging, and
neuropsychological test studies.

Finally, we identified numerous studies reporting on the performance of
tests for detecting feigning ADHD. All studies also reporting also on
the diagnostic performance of diagnosing ADHD are included in the
respective test sections earlier in this chapter and the evidence tables
C1 to C8. Studies used subjective tests such as self-report
questionnaires as well as objective tests such as neuropsychological
test batteries. Results of all studies reporting on feigning ADHD are
shown in the evidence table in the appendix (Appendix Table C9).

# Discussion

This evidence report synthesizes the results of evaluations of available
tools for diagnosing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults.
The systematic review reveals a complex landscape with varying levels of
evidence across assessment approaches. We identified over 100 studies
evaluating the diagnostic performance of self-report questionnaires,
peer review questionnaires, neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging,
electroencephalogram (EEG), diverse biomarkers, clinician tools,
combinations of modalities, and tools to identify feigning ADHD. Despite
the research volume, direct comparisons between tests were limited,
often resulting in insufficient strength of evidence for definitive
evidence statements.

As part of the review, we also addressed a context question regarding
the relative frequency of use of tools, given that the use of tools in
routine care can be quite different from the scientific research
literature. The current frequency of use of the various tools for
diagnosing ADHD in adults by primary care and specialty mental health
clinicians is unknown. Nevertheless, some published reports suggest that
their use is common and widespread. For example, the American Academy of
Family Practitioners recommend obtaining rating scales for ADHD from
both the patient and significant others in the patient's life (spouse, a
close relative, employer, or colleague). Likewise, the American
Psychiatric Association advises the use of ADHD rating scales in
addition an in-depth clinical interview for the ADHD diagnosis.^165^

Large surveys suggest that primary care physicians, psychiatrists, and
psychologists commonly, but nurse practitioners less often, rely on one
or more of these tools when diagnosing ADHD. An online survey of 1,924
U.S. physicians completed a survey about care of adults for ADHD; 83
percent of primary care physicians and 97 percent of psychiatrists
screened for adult ADHD in adults who complained of typical ADHD
symptoms, with 64 percent of primary care physicians and 57 percent of
psychiatrists using an ADHD rating scale to aid their screening.^166^
However, only 20 percent of primary care physicians and 25 percent of
psychiatrists conducted an extended interview to confirm the diagnosis.
Once initiating stimulant treatment, however, 69 percent reported using
a rating scale to help titrate the dose. Another survey of 400 primary
care physicians surveyed indicated that 85 percent would take a more
active role in making an ADHD diagnosis if they had a screening tool
that was appropriately developed and validated and both easy to use and
quickly administered.^167^ Studies of diagnostic reports submitted by
young adults who were seeking academic accommodations at postsecondary
schools or on medical licensing exams showed that most relied primarily
or exclusively on current self-reported symptoms on rating scales,
suggesting their widespread use by psychologists. Those studies also
reported, however, that the clinicians failed to obtain collateral
reports, confirm childhood onset, establish functional impairment, or
rule out other potential causes for the reported symptoms.^168-171^ A
survey mailed to 262 nurse practitioners in Alaska indicated that only
12 percent were likely to diagnose ADHD in practice; 38 percent of the
68 who responded to a question about methods used to diagnose ADHD in
adults reported using a diagnostic screening tool.^172^

Neuropsychological test measures and specialized rating scales are also
commonly used for both diagnostic and clinical assessment of ADHD in
adults. This is particularly true with the recent promulgation of
commercial, computer-based platforms for administering various versions
of the Continuous Performance Task (CPT), such as the QB test, that
claim diagnostic utility for adults with ADHD. An indirect indication of
the frequency of use of these tests, at least by psychologists and
neuropsychologists, is a Delphi consensus study published in 2019. The
study surveyed 27 clinician researchers from around the world who were
experienced in working with adults who have ADHD and asked them to rate,
over four rounds of questioning that progressively honed a list of most
highly prioritized tests, the importance of neuropsychological functions
in assessing adults who have ADHD, with the aim of composing a list of
the most relevant neuropsychological functions to assess and the
corresponding tools to assess them.^173^ The top five domains identified
and the tools recommended to assess them with strong group consensus
were: (1) sustained attention (assessed using Conners Continuous
Performance Test III), (2) distractibility (Conners CPT III), (3)
inhibitory control (Go/NoGo test), (4) task planning and organization
(the BRIEF self-report survey), (5) working memory (digit span test).
ADHD symptoms identified to assess included impulsivity and
hyperactivity. The assessments were not considered to be diagnostic per
se, because poor scores on the measures can have multiple causes. The
tools were instead recommended for clinical assessment to characterize
neuropsychological functioning in adults already diagnosed with ADHD.

## Comparative diagnostic performance of tools to diagnose ADHD among adults

We identified over 100 studies that assessed putative tools to aid the
diagnosis of ADHD in adults. Although this is a substantial number of
studies, we deemed the strength of evidence for the reported performance
measures across each of categories of diagnostic tools to be generally
low because of large performance variability across studies, the use of
widely varying non-ADHD comparison populations, reporting practices that
precluded meta-analyses across studies, and statistical analyses that
were often exploratory across a large number of variables.

### Measures Reported for Diagnostic Performance

As outlined in detail in the introduction, diagnosing Adult ADHD is
complex and in addition to issues surrounding the reference standard,
this review also highlighted limitations associated with reported
measures. Most studies reported sensitivity (true positive rate),
specificity (true negative rate), and diagnostic accuracy (how many are
correctly diagnosed). Although these are standard performance statistics
for diagnostic classification, they have the important limitation of
being dependent on an arbitrary threshold that is applied to scores from
a diagnostic tool that defines whether individual participants do or do
not have ADHD -- for example, the percent of symptoms endorsed, the
numerical score on a rating of symptom severity or measure of cognitive
performance, or the power in an EEG frequency band. Studies that use the
same diagnostic tool often apply different thresholds to the scores from
that tool, which will necessarily alter the reported sensitivities and
specificities. Comparing sensitivities and specificities across studies
that use differing thresholds is therefore like comparing apples and
oranges.

Moreover, sensitivity and specificity, because of how they are defined
and calculated, inherently have an inverse relationship to one another,
such that raising the diagnostic threshold for a score on a tool will
reduce sensitivity (i.e., it will identify fewer people who truly have
ADHD) but increase specificity (i.e., falsely identify fewer people as
having ADHD who do not in fact have it), and vice versa for lowering the
diagnostic threshold. This inherent trade-off between sensitivity and
specificity establishes an operational limit for plots of sensitive
versus specific as shown in the figures along the y = -x line, i.e.,
from the upper left to lower right corner of the plot, which would
identify diagnostic tests that perform at no better than chance. Tools
in the upper right quadrant of that plot improve in overall performance
as they approach the upper right corner, or perfect accuracy (100% true
positives and 100% true negatives). Identified research shows that, for
categories of tools such as rating scales and neuropsychological test
measures that have the most data points, many studies perform little
better than chance (they lie close to the y = -x line; studies that lie
to the left of it perform worse than chance) and, moreover, because they
lie on or near the diagonal, the findings suggest that variability in
performance likely derives from differences in the thresholds applied to
the scores from the diagnostic tools. Unfortunately, adjusting
sensitivity and specificity through use of the same diagnostic threshold
is impossible without having the scores from the tool for each study
participant. Reports of diagnostic accuracy suffer the same limitation
of depending inherently on the diagnostic threshold applied to the
tool's score.

One index of diagnostic performance that addresses these limitations of
sensitivity and specificity metrics is AUC (area under the curve), a
measure from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves that was
first developed by engineers during World War II to detect enemy objects
in the battlefield. An ROC curve is a plot of sensitivity vs specificity
across the entire range of possible diagnostic thresholds. The area
under this ROC curve provides a single, overall index of performance
that is independent of diagnostic threshold. AUC values range of 0.5
(corresponding to the y=x line) indicate that the tool provides no
information above chance for diagnostic classification. Values of 1.0
(corresponding to the vertical x=0 line) indicate that the tests
performs perfectly, correctly classifying all participants who have ADHD
as having it and all non-ADHD participants as not having it.
Intermediate AUC values of 90 to 100 are commonly classified as
*excellent* performance; 80 to 90 as *good*; 70 to 80 *fair*; 60 to 70
*poor*; and 50 to 60 as *failed*. Studies of diagnostic tools are
increasingly reporting performance in terms of AUC, in addition to the
more traditional measures of sensitivity and specificity.

A minority of studies reported other measures of diagnostic performance,
including positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value
(NPV). They are calculated as PPV = True Positives / (True Positives +
False Positives), and NPV = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False
Negatives). PPV is the probability that a person with a positive test
result has the condition; NPV is the probability that a person with a
negative test result does not have the condition. False positives will
increase and false negatives will decline with lower base rates in the
population -- if no one has the condition, all positive results are
false, and all negative results are correct then PPV will decrease to
0.00 (no one with a positive test result has the condition) and NPV will
increase to 1.00 - everyone with a negative test result does not have
the condition (and the reverse is true if everyone has the condition).
Thus, these metrics represent the utility of diagnostic tools in a
particular setting that has a specific base rate of ADHD in population
sampled. They will differ across varying diagnostic settings because the
base rates of ADHD differ across those settings (the base rate may be,
for example, 60-70% in a clinic where patients assessed for suspected
ADHD, it may be 50% in a study designed to have equal numbers of ADHD
and healthy control participants, or it may be 5% in an epidemiological
sample of the general population). Very few studies that we identified
for inclusion reported PPV and NPV values, generally without providing
accurate and independent estimates of the base rates of ADHD in the
study's specific diagnostic setting.

### []{#_Toc201103576 .anchor}4.1.2 The Importance of the Comparator Sample

Measures of diagnostic accuracy will vary with the characteristics of
the non-ADHD participants from which the diagnostic tool is attempting
to discriminate the study's ADHD participants. For example, if the
non-ADHD participants are patients who have more symptoms that overlap
those of ADHD, as occurs commonly with patients who have autism,
depression, or anxiety, false positives will tend to be higher than in
studies where the non-ADHD participants have few or no symptoms that
overlap, as happens when the comparator group is a sample of
neurotypical controls.

In real-world clinical practice, clinicians rarely if ever need to
determine whether a patient has ADHD or is healthy and symptom-free (the
clinical equivalent of a neurotypical control in many research studies).
The patient has presented to the clinician with some kind of clinical
problem, or they would not be seeing the clinician. That problem likely
has symptoms that overlap those of ADHD, or ADHD would not be considered
as a clinical possibility. For these reasons, the much more clinically
relevant studies of performance for tools that aid the diagnosis of ADHD
are those that employ a comparator group of participants who have mental
health problems and symptoms that may overlap those of ADHD. The
*[most]{.underline}* clinically relevant comparison are from studies in
which all participants were presenting for evaluation of possible ADHD,
because real-world clinicians are asked to diagnose ADHD in patients who
are presenting for an ADHD assessment.^33^ These comparator samples will
tend to produce more false positives in diagnostic testing, thus
lowering specificity metrics.^168^

### []{#_Toc201103577 .anchor}4.1.3 Rating Scales

Numerous studies reported on performance for at least one self-report
measure in diagnosing ADHD (Figure 5). The number of different scales
was large (17), but the most commonly reported measures were the CAARS,
ASRS, and WURS. Studies that used the same measure often applied
different diagnostic cut-offs to the score the measure generates.
Self-reports were generally able to correctly rule out ADHD, with good
but rarely excellent performance and substantial variation across
studies.^71,\ 86,\ 101^

Examination of the plotted sensitivity versus specificity suggests that
sensitivity and specificity measures are similarly distributed around
the y=x line, indicating that self-rating scales are similarly likely to
under-identify individuals who truly have ADHD (reflecting sensitivity)
and to over-identify individuals who do not have ADHD (reflecting
specificity).^168^ Closer examination also suggests that the measures of
CAARS performance tended to lie along the y = -x line or close to it,
suggesting poorer performance independent of the specific diagnostic
threshold used. Measures of the ASRS tended to cluster closer to the
upper right corner, suggesting overall better performance, independent
of the diagnostic threshold used. Only three studies reported
performance for peer ratings, but the characteristics of the studies
preclude interpretation.

### Neuropsychological Tests

A considerable number of studies have been published that report on the
performance of various neuropsychological tests to diagnose ADHD in
adults. Most of these studies assessed performance of a wide range of
measures in a highly exploratory way, without specific hypotheses for
which measures would perform best. All the studies reported on
performance of some form of CPT, but the CPT, like most of the
individual neuropsychological tests, itself generates many measures, and
which of those measures was reported and performed best varied widely
across studies. These approaches to the analysis and reporting of
results greatly complicate comparison of performance across studies and
the interpretation and generalization of findings. The best performing
of the neuropsychological tests are reported here, which risks a
positive bias for assessing overall performance of neuropsychological
tests, but which nevertheless seems to be the most efficient way to
report findings.

With all these caveats, results indicated a substantial false negative
rate in most studies.^95,\ 144^ Sensitivity varied widely, from
excellent for the AQT^118^ to very poor,^146^ with most sensitivity
measures in the fair range or poorer, indicating that neuropsychological
tests often missed the diagnosis in those who truly had ADHD.
Specificity likewise varied widely, from perfect specificity for the
AQT^118^ to poor specificity for QbTest Plus variables,^144^ though in
general, specificity was fair at best, indicating that tests often
incorrectly identified non-ADHD controls as having ADHD.

Comparing sensitivity and specificity measures across categories of
diagnostic tools, neuropsychological tests do not seem to perform better
than self-report measures (self-report measures have more frequent
clusters near the upper right corner of the plots, indicating better
combinations of sensitivity and specificity). Recent systematic reviews
of the diagnostic utility of continuous performance measures for adults
with ADHD have concluded that these tests are vulnerable to practice
effects and the feigning of symptoms, and they alone do not sufficiently
dis­criminate persons who have ADHD from clinical controls.^38,\ 39^

### []{#_Toc201103579 .anchor}4.1.5 Other Diagnostic Tools

With a couple of exceptions, overall diagnostic performance of EEG
measures was fair to good for the dozen studies that reported them,
although, similar to the limitations of neuropsychological test studies,
the EEG measures varied widely across studies and were often highly
exploratory in assessing performance across many measures. Measures, for
example, ranged from resting state EEG,^96,\ 125^ to event-related
potentials during neuropsychological tasks,^54,\ 115^ to EEG recordings
during transcranial magnetic stimulation.^80^ Several of the studies
used machine learning or other techniques to combine various EEG
measures into a highly complex test measure that would be difficult or
impossible to replicate in future studies. Most employed a non-clinical
comparator sample, which likely contributed to the reasonable
performance measures. Sensitivities ranged from perfect performance
during a CPT and using machine learning-derived EEG measure^91^ to fair
performance using resting state EEG measures.^125^ Specificity showed an
even wider range from excellent for event-related potential^54^ to poor
performance in a study evaluating resting state EEG^96^ but was
generally good in identified studies. Most clinical practices and even
research centers do not have EEG capability, let alone under the complex
testing conditions employed in these studies. The real-world
applicability of these measures is therefore currently extremely
limited.

The studies that assessed diagnostic performance for neuroimaging
measures used a wide range of imaging technologies, including SPECT,^48^
3-D SPECT,^136^ structural MRI, DTI,^56^ and resting state
fMRI.^157,\ 161^ Limitations of these studies are similar to those for
EEG measures, with diagnostic test measures highly ad hoc and complex,
precluding generalizability and opportunities for replication.
Comparator samples were often non-clinical, and analyses were often
exploratory across multiple test measures. Sensitivities ranged from
perfect in a large retrospective cohort SPECT study^48^ to poor in a
SPECT study^136^ with a clinical comparator sample. Specificities ranged
from excellent in the retrospective SPECT study^48^ to fair in an fMRI
study).^161^ Also similar to EEG, the real-world applicability of using
neuroimaging methods to aid diagnosis is limited by the practical
challenges in acquiring the imaging measures.

Five studies reported on performance of putative biomarkers in
diagnosing ADHD. Each used a different technology, including a genetic
marker,^79^ eye tracking,^88^ blood oxidative status,^138^ physiological
data from a wearable device,^49^ and Motor Function Neurological
Assessment (MFNU).^150^

## Direct Comparisons of Diagnostic Performance

Because measures of diagnostic performance, especially measures of
sensitivity and specificity, vary with the diagnostic threshold applied
to the score that the diagnostic tool generates, as well as sample
characteristics, interpreting differences in measures of diagnostic
performance across studies is exceedingly difficult. All these
differences in study characteristics undoubtedly contributed to the
scatter of data points in the plots of sensitivity versus specificity
shown in the figures; disentangling all of these effects on measures of
diagnostic performance across studies is impossible.

For these reasons, studies that directly compare measures of performance
across diagnostic tools in the same sample of participants are most
valuable to identify better performing tools. We identified 11 such
studies. Of those, two had only six participants each who had
ADHD^100,\ 132^ and preclude interpretation. One study reported
performance metrics only for EEG measures.^54^ Of the remaining studies,
seven were discriminating participants with ADHD from participants with
other clinical conditions^65,\ 78,\ 98,\ 122,\ 123,\ 145,\ 154^ and one
was discriminating from participants with a mix of patients and
neurotypical controls.^119^ They all assessed performance of self-rating
scales for ADHD symptoms. Those that attempted to make very difficult
clinical discriminations reported the poorest performance (e.g.,
ADHD+ASD vs ASD alone: sensitivity 57%, specificity 81%;^122^ combined
type ADHD vs predominantly Inattentive ADHD: sensitivity 65%,
specificity 61%).^154^ The other studies generally reported
sensitivities ranging from the mid-70's to low 90's, but those with the
highest sensitivities had the lowest specificities, in the high 20's and
low 30's, as expected given the inherent trade-off between sensitivity
and specificity that depends on the diagnostic threshold applied to
scores from the rating scale. Peer ratings were also assessed in three
of the studies:^65,\ 98,\ 122^ one reported substantially lower
sensitivities but higher specificities than for the self-ratings;^65^
one reported performance comparable to self-ratings; ^98^ and one
reported substantially higher sensitivity and specificity when using
both an ADHD scale and an ASD scale in discriminating ASD+ASD from ASD
alone.^122^ Combining the self-ratings and peer ratings in two of these
studies yielded comparable sensitivity in one study,^65^ improved
sensitivity in the other,^98^ and improved specificity in both, compared
with self-ratings alone.

Neuropsychological measures were assessed in five of these
studies.^78,\ 98,\ 119,\ 123,\ 145^ Sensitivities ranged from 30 percent
(corresponding specificity 74%) ^98^to 84 percent (corresponding
specificity 80%),^78^ and specificities ranged from 56 percent
(corresponding sensitivity 73.3%)^123^ to 86 percent (corresponding
sensitivity 47%).^145^ Generally, however, performance of these as
stand-alone measures was poorer than for self-ratings, and studies were
inconsistent in identifying which of the numerous measures from the
continuous performance measurement (e.g., omission errors, commission
errors, reaction time variability) provided the best performance. Three
of these studies assessed diagnostic performance when combining
self-ratings with continuous performance measures.^78,\ 119,\ 123^ One
found substantially better sensitivity than for the neuropsychological
test alone and better specificity than for the self-rating alone, one
found better sensitivity and specificity than for the continuous
performance test alone,^78^ and one did not report sensitivity or
specificity for the combination.^119^

These findings from head-to-head comparisons, taken together, suggest
that the combination of self-ratings, peer ratings, and continuous
performance test scores may one day prove more useful than either
measure alone in accurately diagnosing ADHD. Currently, however,
self-ratings combined with peer ratings offer the best evidence for
improving diagnostic performance over either rating alone.

## []{#_Toc193750164 .anchor}4.3 Implications

Self-report scales are easy to use tools to aid the diagnosis of ADHD in
both primary and specialty care settings. They are prone, however, to
both false positive and false negative findings, especially when used in
a setting where adults present for evaluation of suspected ADHD. A
negative test is reassuring but not conclusive, and it likely prompts in
a patient complaining about ADHD symptoms an assessment of current
symptoms, as well as retrospective assessment of symptoms earlier in
childhood (when symptom expression may have been more complete) from
other sources -- including spouses, significant others, parents,
siblings, and teacher comments in school records. A negative test also
prompts questions about other mental health problems whose symptoms
overlap those of ADHD, especially depression, anxiety, substance abuse,
stress, and trauma.

Self-report scales are also prone to false positives, most often from
the presence of one or more of these conditions with overlapping
symptoms. Therefore, assessing the validity of positive responses to
questions on the scale helps in deciding how likely the test result is
to be a true positive. Thus, patients with a positive test results
should elaborate on experiences of symptoms in their own words, noting
when the symptoms first began to discern if they were present in
childhood, reviewing the trajectory of the symptoms over time, the
settings or experiences that exacerbate them, and what kind of
functional impairment they produce, if any.^16^ ADHD symptoms in
childhood can be assessed by asking patients and parents to complete
retrospective symptom reports on standard checklists, such as the ADHD
rating scale^174^ or the Conners 3 rating scale.^175^ Similar to a
negative test, positive tests also raise questions about overlapping
symptoms from other conditions. Assessing symptoms of other conditions
that can overlap with ADHD symptoms can be done even in a busy clinical
practice through the use of existing scales for depression and anxiety
(such as the PHQ-9^176^ and GAD-7^177^). It is critical to assess
whether positive responses truly represent ADHD or instead the symptoms
of another clinical condition.^16^

Neuropsychological tests, including the CPT, are not routine in
diagnosing ADHD in adults, and both sensitivity and specificity for
these tests are on average lower than for self-report measures.
Certainly, the long and expensive batteries of traditional
neuropsychological testing will not aid diagnosis of ADHD, though they
may serve other clinical purposes. Prior reviews of CPT performance as a
diagnostic tool in adults with ADHD have yielded these same
conclusions.^38,\ 39^ Whether the combination of a CPT with self-report
measures can improve diagnostic performance is at present unclear. In
addition, symptom validity tests and performance validity tests can
detect some invalid presentations in self-reports and inadequate effort
in neuropsychological tests and many experts have recommended the use of
these tools as part of a comprehensive assessment of ADHD in
adults.^178-184^ Identified studies varied regarding the inclusion of
validity tests. In addition, an individual's effort during testing can
fluctuate significantly over the course of an assessment, and
individuals differ in what cognitive abilities they choose to exaggerate
or feign deficits.^110,\ 185^

Finally, the quality of evidence for objective tests that are not
vulnerable to impression management such as EEG, neuroimaging, and
biomarkers, as tools to diagnose ADHD in adults is low. None of the
performance findings have been replicated, and no clinical effectiveness
studies have been conducted to assess use of these tools in the real
world to diagnose ADHD. From a practical perspective, very few primary
care or specialty mental health clinicians have access to these
technologies. Thus, these tools are not even remotely close to being
ready for clinical application to aid diagnosis, even though the FDA has
approved one EEG measure as a purported diagnostic aid.^186,\ 187^

## []{#_Toc193981789 .anchor}4.4 Strengths, Limitations, and Applicability

A strength of this review is its scope and inclusiveness - publications
did not have date restrictions, and they were not limited to use of any
pre-specified tools, which led to inclusion of novel EEG, neuroimaging,
and biomarker studies in the diagnosis of ADHD. Nonetheless, this review
was limited to diagnostic accuracy studies and did not focus on
psychometric considerations such as the validity of symptoms supporting
a diagnosis. In addition, we restricted the review to English-language
studies, which will have missed some tools used locally outside of the
U.S. and other English-speaking countries.

The conclusions of this review are limited by the poor quality of
evidence for performance of every category of diagnostic tool and by the
paucity of reporting findings that would support meta-analysis across
studies, including AUCs, false positive and negative rates, and the
thresholds applied to scores from the diagnostic tools. Furthermore,
limiting to studies reporting on a reference standard added focus to the
review, but given the issues surrounding a clinical diagnosis of ADHD in
adults also needs to acknowledge that there is no true and universally
accepted gold standard in this research area.

Finally, several included studies reported multiple exclusions for
eligible participants, which hinders the generalizability of the
findings to patients seen in routine practice, in particular in primary
care. Furthermore, some studies used sophisticated and resource-intense
assessment methods, as well as advanced analytic procedures to optimize
diagnostic performance. Hence, diagnostic performance may not translate
from the favorable effects shown in the documented research to real
world practice and likely represent a best-case scenario.

## Next Steps

Despite the limitations of studies thus far, it seems clear from their
findings that no single rating scale or neuropsychological test, and
probably no single neuroimaging algorithm or biomarker, will provide the
desired combination of high sensitivity and high specificity in
diagnosing adults who have ADHD in real-world settings, where the
clinical question is whether a given individual who is suspected of
having ADHD actually has it. The relatively few studies that have
directly compared the performance of diagnostic tools with one another
provide some early indication that the combination of tools may yield
may improve both sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ADHD compared
with the use of any single tool alone. Future studies should compare the
performance of tools within and across categories, both singly and in
combination. The methods for optimally combining measures across
different tools should be made explicit and have a clear rationale.
Algorithms for combining measures that are based on machine learning,
neural networks, or other similar "black box" technologies should be
made publicly available to facilitate validation, replication, and
dissemination. Much more research is needed to determine how to combine
data optimally across informants or tools.^16,\ 33^

Future studies should move past the use of neurotypical comparator
groups, which have little or no real-world clinical relevance, and
instead assess diagnostic performance only in clinical samples. Further,
future studies should assess diagnostic performance in clinically
important participant subgroups, including subgroups defined by age,
sex, race, ethnicity, and the presence of disorders that commonly
co-occur with ADHD, if only to be able to say with more confidence that
there are no differences. We cannot assume that the absence of research
equates to the absence of evidence and we had to note several times that
the evidence was simply insufficient for more concrete evidence
statements. Because the diagnosis of ADHD requires childhood onset,
studies are needed to assess how best to assess and validate the
presence of symptoms in childhood.^168^ It is often difficult to obtain
childhood educational and medical records and adults' recall of
childhood symptoms is limited.^16,\ 168,\ 169,\ 188-193^ More research
is also needed on measures to detect invalid responses in completing
self-report ADHD rating scales and inadequate effort on
neuropsychological tests.^33^

Future studies of diagnostic tools should report their findings in much
more detail to support meta-analyses across studies. This would include
reporting false positive and negative rates, the thresholds applied to
scores from the diagnostic tools, and any data manipulation used to
produce the finding. Studies should also report ROC analyses to support
comparisons of test performance across studies that are independent of
diagnostic thresholds. Studies should also make available their
individual-level data in public repositories to support future efforts
at replication, synthesis, and new discovery.

Although currently available "objective" measures of neurocognitive
performance are not likely to be useful tools in diagnosing ADHD in
adults, continued search for and development of better objective,
performance-based measures is warranted. Candidate tools will need to
overcome the limitations identified for prior continuous performance
tests and other neuropsychological tests. New, better-performing tools
will need to correlated better with ADHD symptom ratings, have better
test-retest reliability, have fewer ceiling effects that likely
contribute to false negative diagnoses, and have greater ecological
validity -- i.e., better simulate the effects of external and
environmental distractions that disrupt attention in everyday life.
^33,\ 38,\ 39,\ 173^

Finally, studies are needed to assess the consequences of being
correctly or incorrectly diagnosed as having ADHD and any unintended
consequences and adverse effects of diagnostic tools.
